# Introduction to Databases

A database is defined as a structured collection of data that includes a specific method for accessing and manipulating that information. While physical objects like filing cabinets, to-do lists, and phone books are technically collections of data, they lack the efficiency and utility of a modern digital database.

A phone book is easy to use if you are looking up a person by their last name because the data is organized alphabetically, but it becomes nearly impossible to use if you need to find every person with a specific first name or area code.

To solve the limitations of physical records, digital databases rely on a database management system to handle the interaction between the user and the raw data. A database management system is the specialized software or code that allows a person or an application to perform actions like adding new records, updating existing information, or deleting data.

In professional environments, people often use the term database to describe both the stored information and the software used to manage it, even though they are technically two different components.

## SQL and MySQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is the actual language used to communicate with a database. It allows a user to perform specific actions like searching for users over a certain age or adding a new username to a system. 

MySQL is a database management system that uses the SQL language to function. While SQL is the language itself, MySQL is the software that implements that language to store and organize data. There are many other database management systems such as Postgres or Oracle that also use SQL. 

>[!NOTE]
>Because SQL is an industry standard, the code used to find a user in a MySQL database is often identical to the code used in a Postgres database.

While these systems share the same language, they are distinguished by their unique features rather than the code they use. Different systems offer various advantages in areas like security, speed, and how they handle user permissions.
